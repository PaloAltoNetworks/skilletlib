#
# Example Output Capturing
#
# In order to properly validate a config, it is often necessary to convert the XML structure to an object, which
# can then be used in jinja expression to perform basic logic and validation. These examples demonstrate how
# skillets are optimized for this task.

label: Example of how to use capture_value

description: |
  This example Skillet shows how to parse and validate a config using output capturing. This example get the value
  for the given xpath using 'capture_value'. This value is captured into a variable called 'hostname'. We can then
  use this variable in a test to validate the supplied configuration passes.

type: pan_validation
labels:
  collection:
    - Example Skillets
    - Validation
  # note the default_documentation_link label, This will get applied to every test that does not specify a doc link
  default_documentation_link: https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/skilletlib/blob/develop/docs/source/examples.rst

variables:
  - name: SOME_VARIABLE
    description: Some VARIABLE
    default: present
    type_hint: text

snippets:
  - name: parse config variable and capture outputs
    cmd: parse
    variable: config
    outputs:
      - name: hostname
        # Directly capture the value found at this xpath. When you only need a specific value from the config,
        # capture_value can be useful. Otherwise, a capture_object with multiple tests using 'element_value'
        # may be useful.
        capture_value: /config/devices/entry/deviceconfig/system/hostname

  - name: ensure_hostname_was_found
    label: Ensures the hostname was found using capture_value
    # simple boolean test using jinja expression logic
    test: hostname == 'skillet_test_hostname'
    # the value of the default_documentation_label will be used here instead. This helps if you have many tests
    # that all have the same doc links
