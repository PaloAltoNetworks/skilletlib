label: Workflow Example with Snippet Filtering

description: |
  This example shows how to build a workflow type skillet. This will chain together multiple different skillets, of
  potentially different types, into a single execution. You may also filter snippets for inclusion / exclusion
  using the filter_snippets attribute.

type: workflow

labels:
  collection:
    - Test Skillets

variables:


snippets:
  # in the workflow skillet case, each 'snippet' is the name of a skillet to execute in turn
  - name: update_schedule
    # you may optional filter snippet in or out using the include_by_name, include_by_tag, and include_by_regex
    # options. The inverse exclude_by options are also supported. The value of each may be a list or a single item
    include_by_name:
      - get_update_schedule
      - update_schedule_configured
      - ensure_wildfire_check_1_min
  - name: edl_checks
    # includes can be mixed and matched
    include_name: edl_captures
    include_by_regex: check_.*
  - name: device_system_checks
    include_by_tag:
      - device_system
