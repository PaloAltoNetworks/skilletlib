label: Example of how to use validations to ensure the state of the configuration.

description: |
  This example Skillet shows how to parse and validate a config using xpath syntax. This example checks the configured
  zones to ensure we do not have one with the attribute name equal to 'does-not-exist'

type: pan_validation

labels:
  collection:
    - Test Skillets
    - Validation

variables:
  - name: zone_to_test
    description: Name of the Zone to test for absence
    default: does-not-exist
    type_hint: text

  - name: zones
    description: list of zones to test
    default: []
    type_hint: list

snippets:
  - name: ensure_zones_is_populated
    cmd: validate
    label: Ensure Zones are not an empty list
    test: zones | length
    fail_message: Zones is an empty list!

  # simple test using a jinja expression to verify the 'zone_to_test' variable is not in the 'zone_names' test
  - name: ensure_desired_zone_absent_from_list
    # pan_validation skillet have a default cmd of 'validate'
    cmd: validate
    # note here that you can use jinja variable interpolation just about anywhere
    label: Ensures the {{ zone_to_test }} zone is not configured
    test: zone_to_test not in zones
    fail_message: |
      This fail message contains a variable, which is useful for debugging and testing.
      captured values were: {{ zones |tojson }}
    # documentation link helps give the user some context about why this test failed or how to manually remediate
