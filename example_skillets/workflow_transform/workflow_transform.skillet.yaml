kabel: Workflow Example with Transforms

description: |
  Workflows are a simple way to tie together different skillets. Transforms are used to map the outputs from one skillet
  into the input of another.

type: workflow

labels:
  collection:
    - Test Skillets

variables:


snippets:
    # in the workflow skillet case, each 'snippet' is the name of a skillet to execute in turn. You may optionally also
    # include a transform attribute, which will map the output from one skillet to the input of another
    # in this case, gather_info will capture a list of zone names using the variable name zone_names
  - name: gather_info

    # check_zones however, requires a list of zone names to be in a variable named zones. Rather than ask the skillet
    # author to coordinate on variable naming, you can supply a simple transform here
  - name: check_zones
    transform:
      - name: zones
        source: zone_names
      - name: another_set_of_zones
        source: something_else
