description: |
  This example Skillet shows how to parse and validate a config using jinja filters. This example checks the configured
  zones to ensure the desired zone contains the desired interface.

type: pan_validation
labels:
  collection:
    - Example Skillets
    - Validation

variables:
  - name: zone_to_test
    description: Name of the Zone to test
    default: internet
    type_hint: text
  - name: interface_to_test
    description: Name of the Interface to test
    default: ethernet1/1
    type_hint: text


snippets:
  - name: parse config variable and capture outputs
    # cmd parse will pass the value of the named `variable` directly to the output for output parsing.
    # for skillet type: pan_validation the default output_type is xml. So capture_object will try to treat the
    # variable as an XML document and convert the element found at the 'xpath' into an object
    cmd: parse
    variable: config
    outputs:
      # create a variable named 'desired_zone' from the element found at the given xpath. Note the use of a variable
      # in the capture_object xpath
      - name: desired_zone
        capture_object: /config/devices/entry/vsys/entry/zone/entry[@name="{{ zone_to_test }}"]

  - name: ensure_desired_zone
    label: Ensures the {{ zone_to_test }} zone is configured
    test: desired_zone is not none

    # note the when conditional can check the result of previous validation steps. This example is a bit contrived
    # but, nonetheless, this can be a powerful feature
    when: ensure_desired_zone.results == True
    # variables can be used almost anywhere, includeing in labels, when conditions, fail_messages, etc
    label: Ensure the {{ interface_to_test }} interface is configured in the {{ zone_to_test }} zone
    # check the desired_zone to ensure it contains a value equal to our interface_to_test from the list of members
    # found at the 'network.layer3.member' level.
    test: desired_zone | element_value_contains('network.layer3.member', interface_to_test)
